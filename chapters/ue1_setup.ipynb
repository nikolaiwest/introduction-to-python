    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Environments are crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dependency Management:** Different Python projects might require different versions of libraries or even Python itself. Environments make it easier to manage project-specific dependencies. You can install, upgrade, and remove packages in an environment without affecting others. Often, Python projects include a \n",
    "`requirements.txt` file, listing all the packages needed for that project. With an environment, you can install all these dependencies at their correct versions with a single command.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Project Isolation:** Each environment is isolated from others, meaning you can have projects with different dependencies or even different Python versions without conflict. Environments prevent the need to install packages globally, which could potentially lead to version conflicts or affect system-wide Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplifying Collaboration:** When collaborating on a project, environments ensure that all contributors are working with the same set of dependencies, reducing *\"works on my machine\"* problems. When sharing a project, you can include your `requirements.txt` file (or the equivalent for your environment manager) that specifies all the necessary dependencies. Others can create a new environment using this file, ensuring that they have the exact setup needed to run the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Streamlining Deployment:** Environments can be replicated across development, testing, and production systems, ensuring consistency across all stages of development. Environments can help mirror the production environment in development, again, reducing the *\"works on my machine\"* problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using environments, you can work on multiple projects on the same machine without worrying about creating conflicts between their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and utilizing environments is a fundamental skill for Python developers, streamlining development workflows and enhancing project collaboration and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**1. Use environments for all projects** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Even simple projects can benefit from the isolation environments provide.\n",

It is considered good practice to store projects (or repositories) separately to add an extra layer of organization. This is particularly usefull if you are managing multiple projects on one system. This approach helps in segregating your work into a dedicated workspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be directly under your user directory (e.g., `C:\\Users\\YourName\\envs`) or any other location where you prefer to store projects. If it doesn't already exist, you have to create it.\n",

    "\n",
    "**4. Activate the Virtual Environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with the Virtual Environment, we can now to activate it like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows: Please remember to use backslash, like this (`\\`).  In Windows, the backslash (`\\`) is the standard path separator, while in Unix-like systems, it's the forward slash (`/`). This distinction can lead to confusion, especially when activating virtual environments or navigating directories across different operating system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the environment is active, you should see your CLI change to something like this: \n",

Instead, place them in a separate directory (like we did with `/envs`) or use a tool that manages environments outside your project directories (we will get to that in the next chapter). This approach keeps your repositories clean and makes them easier to share and collaborate on, as the environments are inherently specific to a developer's local setup.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html) is a minimal installer for Conda. It is a smaller, bootstrap version that includes only Conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's an excellent choice for anyone who wants the Conda environment and package manager without the overhead of the full [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Installing Miniconda:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Miniconda installer for your operating system from the [official Miniconda page](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"../images/ue1_miniconda-install.png\" height=\"400\">\n",

    "Please make sure to add the Miniconda to PATH as well. Follow this [tutorial](https://eduand-alvarez.medium.com/setting-up-anaconda-on-your-windows-pc-6e39800c1afb) in case you are encountering any unforseen issues during the installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Creating a Conda Environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Miniconda is installed, you can create a new environment with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name myenv python=3.11 pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name and `python=3.11` with the specific Python version you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running this, you may read *\"Solving the environment\"*. This involves conda analyzing the current environment's specifications, including installed packages, and the requirements of the packages you want to install, update, or remove. The goal is to figure out the most compatible set of packages that meet all the dependencies' requirements. Feel free to explore condas [documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that step is done, conda will show you what is going to be installed. You will be asked to confirm these installations. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "Proceed ([y]/n)?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `y` and hit enter to create the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Activating the Conda Environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the environment, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see all installed environments, like this: \n",

    "```bash \n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "> **1. Separate your environments** \n",
    "\n",
    "Use separate environments for different projects to avoid conflicts between package versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **2. Keep Conda Updated** \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "conda update conda\n",
    "conda update --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **3. Consider using Environment Files** \n",
    "For complex projects, consider using an environment file (`environment.yml`) for reproducibility. This file specifies all the necessary packages for your project. We are not going to use this within this course, but you may learn more [here](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/04-sharing-environments/index.html). "
