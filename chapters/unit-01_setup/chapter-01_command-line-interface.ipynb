    "\n",
    "Please note, the `/s` and `/q` options make `rmdir` a very powerful command that can quickly delete large amounts of data. It should be used with caution, as there is no \"undo\" function for this operation. Always double-check the directory name before using `rmdir /s /q` to avoid accidentally deleting important files or directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For safety, especially when learning, you might want to use `rmdir` without the `/q` option first. This prompts for confirmation before deletion, providing an extra safeguard against accidental data loss.\n",

    "### **Create a Python File with `echo`, `touch` and `nano`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands `touch` and `nano` aren't available with Windows OS. You can use them with all other OS or with installing Git Bash. Git Bash is a command line application used primarily on Windows to provide a Unix-like environment for working with Git. It combines:\n",

    "- Git: A distributed version control system that developers use to track changes to source code (more in chapter 5).\n",
    "- Bash: A Unix shell and command line interpreter typically used on Linux and macOS systems.\n",

    "1. **`echo`:** You can create an empty python file with the known command `echo.>` followed by the filename, e.g. `filename.py`. The file is automatically saved in the actual directory. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. To fill the file with program code open the file with an editor like Visual Studio Code. Write the code and save it with `Ctrl + S`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another option to create and fill a Python file with `echo` is shown in the following example. The first command creates `filename.py` and writes the first row of the program (print(\"First row\")). The second and third command adds the next row of the program (print(\"Second row\")). This is characterized by `>>`. \n",

    "2. **`touch`:** The command `touch` followed by the filename, e.g. `filename.py` also creates an empty python file. The file is automatically saved in the actual directory. If the file already exists, it will not be overwritten. Only the timestamp is updated without changing the content of the file. This is where the `touch` command differs from the `echo.>` command, which always creates an empty file or clears an existing file. To fill the file with program code open the file with an editor like Visual Studio Code. Write the code and save it with `Ctrl + S`.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **`nano`:** A faster alternative to the `touch` command is the `nano` command. With the texteditor `nano` you can create a file and directly write and save a program in that file. Navigate to the created directory and open the texteditor with:\n",
