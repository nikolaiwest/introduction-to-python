    "As you begin your journey in Python programming, one of the first skills you'll need to develop is using the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it may seem daunting at first, the CLI is an essential tool for Python developers, allowing for efficient file management, script execution, and interaction with various Python tools and libraries.

    "**1. Print Working Directory: `cd`** \n",
    "\n",
    "Displays the current directory path. This command is crucial for orientation within the file system, helping users understand their current location in the directory structure. In Windows, `cd` without arguments serves this purpose, unlike Unix-based systems that use `pwd`.\n",

    "* `cd ..`: Moves up one level to the parent directory\n",

    "* `cd \\`: Moves to the root directory of the current drive\n",
    "\n",
    "* `cd /d D:`: Changes both the drive and directory at once (to drive D: in this example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `cd .` doesn't change the current directory, as `.` refers to the current directory itself. This might seem useless at first, but it can be helpful in scripts or when you want to verify the current location without changing it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* `/s`: This stands for *Subdirectories*. It removes the specified directory and all subdirectories and files in the directory tree.\n",
    "* `/q`: This stands for *Quiet*. It runs the command in quiet mode, which means it doesn't ask for confirmation before deleting a non-empty directory.\n",

    "C:\\Users\\user\\projects\\introduction-to-python>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `/s /q` tells the command to remove the `not_empty_folder`, all its contents (including subdirectories and files), and to do so without asking for confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, the `/s` and `/q` options make `rmdir` a very powerful command that can quickly delete large amounts of data. It should be used with caution, as there is no \"undo\" function for this operation. Always double-check the directory name before using `rmdir /s /q` to avoid accidentally deleting important files or directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For safety, especially when learning, you might want to use `rmdir` without the `/q` option first. This prompts for confirmation before deletion, providing an extra safeguard against accidental data loss.\n",

    "\n",
    "In many development environments, it's common to have a dedicated folder for all your projects or *repositories*. This is often called a \"repo\" folder (short for \"repository\"). Using a `/repo` folder helps keep your projects organized and separated from other files on your system. For this exercise, we'll simulate this practice by creating and using a `/repo` folder on your desktop.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Open your command prompt.\n",

    "\n",
    "8. Change into the `project_files` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Inside `project_files`, create two empty text files, called `document1.txt` and `notes.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Use the `dir` command to verify that both files were created.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Move back up to the `cli_practice` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Copy the `document1.txt` file from `project_files` to the backups directory, renaming it to `document1_backup.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Rename the `project_files` directory to `main_project`.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Clear the command prompt screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. List the contents of the `cli_practice` directory to see your project structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Navigate into the `main_project` directory and list its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Finally, clean up by moving back to the desktop and removing the entire `repos` directory and its contents.\n",
    "\n",
