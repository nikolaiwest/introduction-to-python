    "# **Chapter 2:** Environments and Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of Python programming, managing your development environment is crucial for creating robust, scalable, and maintainable projects. This chapter introduces two fundamental concepts that are essential for every Python developer: `environments` and `packages`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `environment` in Python is a self-contained directory that contains a specific Python installation and a set of additional packages. This setup allows different projects to operate independently, ensuring that changes made in one project do not affect others. Understanding and effectively using environments is key to avoiding dependency conflicts and maintaining clean, reproducible development setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "`packages`, on the other hand, are reusable pieces of code that extend the functionality of Python. They allow developers to leverage existing solutions for common problems, speeding up development and improving code quality. Managing packages effectively within your environments is crucial for maintaining your projects.\n",

    "The image above illustrates the concept of virtual environments in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Isolated Environments:** Each rectangle represents a separate virtual environment. These environments are isolated from each other and the system's global Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Different Python Versions:** Each environment can have its own Python version. In this example, we see Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.10 across different environments. This allows you to work on projects requiring different Python versions without conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Specific Package Versions:** Within each environment, you can install specific versions of packages. For instance, Virtual Environment 1 has NumPy 1.14.4 and Matplotlib 2.2.5, while Virtual Environment 3 has more recent versions of Pandas and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Project-Specific Dependencies:** Each environment can have its own set of installed libraries tailored to the needs of a specific project. This prevents conflicts between projects that might require different versions of the same library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization demonstrates how virtual environments enable you to maintain multiple, isolated Python setups on a single machine, each with its own version of Python and package dependencies. This isolation is key to managing complex projects and ensuring reproducibility across different development environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will guide you through the concepts of environments and packages, teaching you how to set up, manage, and utilize them effectively in your Python projects. We'll cover tools like `venv` for creating virtual environments, `pip` for package management, and introduce you to `Conda` as an alternative solution. By the end of this chapter, you'll have the knowledge to create isolated, reproducible Python environments for your projects, making your development process more efficient and your projects more manageable.\n",

    "## **Chapter 2.1:** Understanding Python Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Python Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python environment is like a separate workspace on your computer where you can work on Python projects. Imagine it as a virtual toolbox that contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A specific version of Python (like Python 3.8 or 3.9)\n",
    "2. A set of additional tools (called packages or libraries) that extend what Python can do\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to understand is that each environment is separate from others. This separation is crucial because it allows you to have different setups for different projects without them interfering with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are Environments Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down why environments are so useful, especially for beginners:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependency Management:** In programming, a \"dependency\" is a piece of software that your project needs to work correctly. Different projects often need different versions of these dependencies. Environments let you install exactly what each project needs without causing conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Project Isolation:** By keeping projects separate, you avoid a common problem where changing something for one project accidentally breaks another. It's like having separate drawers for different types of tools – you don't mix your kitchen utensils with your gardening tools!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reproducibility:** This means being able to recreate the exact setup needed to run a project. It's particularly important when you're sharing your work with others or moving it to a different computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clean Testing:** When you're learning to code, it's helpful to have a \"clean slate\" to test your programs. Environments give you this clean slate every time, ensuring that your tests are reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Python Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different types of environments you might encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System-wide Python Installation:** This is the default Python setup that comes when you first install Python on your computer. While it's okay for very basic use, it's generally not recommended for serious development because changes here can affect your entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Virtual Environments:** These are lightweight, isolated Python setups created using tools like `venv` (which we'll explore later). They're great for most projects because they're easy to create and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conda Environments:** These are similar to virtual environments but are created and managed by a tool called Conda. Conda can handle not just Python packages, but also other software dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using environments offers several benefits, especially as you progress in your Python journey:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Safe Experimentation:** You can try out new packages or different versions of Python without risking your main setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Easier Collaboration:** When working with others, environments ensure everyone has the same setup, reducing \"it works on my machine\" problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Learning Different Python Versions:** As a beginner, you might want to learn both older and newer versions of Python. Environments let you switch between versions easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cleaner System:** By using environments, you keep your main system Python clean and uncluttered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Using Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "As you start using environments, keep these tips in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use environments for all projects:** Even for small projects, it's good to get into the habit of using environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keep a list of your project's needs:** Use a file called `requirements.txt` to list all the packages your project needs. This makes it easy to recreate your environment later.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Name your environments clearly:** Use names that tell you what the environment is for, like \"web_project\" or \"data_analysis_course\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Don't be afraid to create new environments:** If you're not sure if you need a new environment, it's usually better to create one. They're easy to delete later if you don't need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding environments might seem a bit overwhelming at first, but as you practice, you'll find they make your Python journey much smoother. They allow you to keep your projects organized, avoid conflicts between different projects, and make it easier to share your work with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections, we'll dive into how to actually create and use these environments, starting with a tool called `venv` that comes built-in with Python.\n",

    "## **Chapter 2.2:** Using `venv` for Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments are a fundamental tool in Python development, allowing developers to create isolated spaces for their projects. The `venv` module, which comes built into Python 3.3 and later, is the standard tool for creating these environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is venv?\n",
    "\n",
    "`venv` (short for \"virtual environment\") is a Python module that creates a unique directory containing a Python installation and additional packages. This isolated environment ensures that the dependencies of one project don't interfere with those of another or with the system-wide Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Importance of venv\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `venv` is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Project Isolation:** Each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what other projects need.\n",
    "2. **Dependency Management:** Avoid conflicts between project requirements and system-wide packages.\n",
    "3. **Consistent Development Environments:** Ensure all developers on a project are working with the same dependencies.\n",
    "4. **Clean Testing Environment:** Test your code in a fresh environment, free from unintended influences.\n",
    "5. **Easy Deployment:** Simplify the process of setting up your project on different machines.\n"

    "### Basic `venv` Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The following commands are essential for working with virtual environments using venv. While these commands work across different operating systems, the activation command differs slightly between Windows and Unix-based systems (macOS/Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Create a Virtual Environment: `python -m venv <env_name>`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This command creates a new virtual environment. It's the first step in setting up an isolated Python environment for your project.\n",
    "\n",

    "*Output:*\n",
    "```cmd\n",
    "C:\\Users\\user\\projects>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After execution, a new directory named `myproject_env` is created in the current directory, containing the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Activate the Virtual Environment (Windows): `<env_name>\\Scripts\\activate`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This command activates the virtual environment on Windows systems. Once activated, you'll be using the Python interpreter and packages installed in this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the `(myproject_env)` prefix in the command prompt, indicating that the environment is now active.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Activate the Virtual Environment (macOS/Linux): `source <env_name>/bin/activate`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the equivalent activation command for Unix-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Deactivate the Virtual Environment: `deactivate`**\n",
    "This command is used to exit the current virtual environment and return to the global Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Check Python Version in Virtual Environment: `python --version`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This command shows the Python version of the active environment. It's useful for verifying that you're using the correct Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, these five commands form the core of working with virtual environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* python -m venv <env_name> creates the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<env_name>\\Scripts\\activate or source <env_name>/bin/activate activates it.\n",
    "\n",
    "deactivate exits the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "python --version helps verify the environment's Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and using these commands allows you to create, activate, and manage virtual environments effectively, providing isolated workspaces for your Python projects."

    "## **Chapter 2.3:** Managing Packages with pip\n",
    "### **Introduction to pip**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` is the *package installer for Python*. It's included with Python versions 3.4 and above, meaning it comes pre-installed. It allows you to install, update, and remove packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI), a repository of Python software. By using pip, you can easily integrate third-party packages and modules into your projects, which can greatly simplify and speed up development. Third-party packages are libraries or modules that have been created by independent developers or organizations and are not part of the standard Python library. Popular examples are (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic pip Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Installing Packages `pip install <package-name>`:**\n",
    "The most common use of pip is to install packages from PyPI. You can install a package by typing `pip install` followed by the package name and optional the version of the package. If you don't define the version, the actual version will be installed. For example, to install the Numpy library version 1.19.5, you would type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy==1.19.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Updating Packages `pip install --upgrade <package-name>`:**\n",
    "To update an installed package to the latest version, you add `--upgrade` to the `pip install` command. To check the version and update the package numpy (if necessary), type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Uninstalling Packages `pip uninstall <package-name>`:**\n",
    "If you no longer need a package, you can uninstall it using `pip uninstall` followed by the package name.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip uninstall numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Listing Installed Packages `pip list`:**\n",
    "To see which packages are currently installed in your Python environment use `pip list`. This will display all installed packages along with their version numbers.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using `requirements.txt`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating requirements.txt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A requirements.txt file is a convenient way to manage project dependencies. It lists all the installed packages for your project and their versions, ensuring that the development and production environments remain consistent. The requirements.txt file can be included in verion control or shared with others, e.g. if several developers want to work on the same project. You can generate a requirements.txt file from the currently installed packages in your environment using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing Packages from requirements.txt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to continue a project on a new machine or for somebody else, you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This command reads the file and installs each package with the specified version.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separate your project repository and your virtual environment directory:**  \n",
    "    The generally recommended practice is not to store virtual environments directly in project repositories. Instead, place them in a separate directory (like we did with `/envs`) or use a tool that manages environments outside your project directories (we will get to that in the next chapter). This approach keeps your repositories clean and makes them easier to share and collaborate on, as the environments are inherently specific to a developer's local setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Upgrade pip (optional but recommended):**  \n",
    "    It's a good practice to ensure that pip, along with setuptools and wheel, is up-to-date within your environment to avoid potential issues when installing packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This command upgrades pip and two other packages that are often required for the installation of other packages."

    "\n",
    "### **Introduction to Conda**\n",
    "Conda is an open-source package management and environment management system that allows you to easily manage dependencies and different programming environments. It quickly installs, runs, and updates `packages` and their dependencies and can also easily create, save, load, and switch between environments on your local computer.It is particularly popular for managing scientific computing libraries, as it can handle packages and dependencies for multiple programming languages (Python, R, Ruby, JavaSkript, etc.). Conda is part of the larger Anaconda distribution, which comes with many pre-installed packages (e.g. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.) and includes also non-Python packages (e.g., system-level libraries like libcurl). This makes it a go-to tool for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. Miniconda offers a smaller, lighter version of Conda without the pre-installed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda manages both packages and virtual environments, whereas pip primarily manages packages and venv is a tool for creating isolated Python environments, but doesn't manage packages.\n",

    "Please install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/) to use the following commands. Please make sure to add the Miniconda to PATH as well. Follow this [video tutorial](https://eduand-alvarez.medium.com/setting-up-anaconda-on-your-windows-pc-6e39800c1afb) in case you are encountering any unforseen issues during the installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Creating a Conda Environment `conda create --name <env-name> python=<version>`:**  \n",
    "To create a new Conda environment, use the following command. You can specify the name and Python version you want. Additionally you can append the packages you want to install in your environment to the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name myenv python=3.11 pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When running this, you may read *\"Solving the environment\"*. This involves conda analyzing the current environment's specifications, including installed packages, and the requirements of the packages you want to install, update, or remove. The goal is to figure out the most compatible set of packages that meet all the dependencies' requirements. Feel free to explore condas [documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more details. \n",

    "**2. Activating and Deactivating Conda Environments `conda activate <env-name>`:**  \n",
    "Once an environment is created, you need to activate it before using it. To activate the environment type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",

    "\n",
    "**3. Installing Packages with Conda `conda install <package-name>`:**  \n",
    "You can install packages like Numpy into a Conda environment using the following command. Conda will ensure that the installed packages are compatible with each other, solving any dependency issues automatically:\n",

    "### **Conda vs. pip: When to Use Which**\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Conda`:**  \n",
    "- Manage *environments and packages* that have *system-level dependencies* (e.g. C libraries).\n",
    "- Install packages for *multiple languages* (Python, R, Ruby, JavaSkript, etc.).\n",
    "- For work with *data science, machine learning, or scientific computing libraries* (e.g., TensorFlow, SciPy) where complex dependencies are common.\n",
    "- You need to install Anaconda or Miniconda, is *not pre-installed*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`pip`:**  \n",
    "- Doesn't manage environments, focuses on installing Python *packages from PyPI*.\n",
    "- A smaller tool for managing *Python-only projects*.\n",
    "- Is *pre-installed* with Python versions 3.4 and above.\n",

    "You can also use both together. First, use Conda to manage the environment and install system-level dependencies, and then use pip to install specific Python packages not available in the Conda repository. While pip and Conda can often be used together, there can be conflicts if you mix packages installed via both pip and Conda. This is because they use different package sources and dependency management systems. The command `pip freeze > requirements.txt` can also be used for packeges that are installed with `conda`. But note, that non-Python dependencies (e.g. C libraries) are not covered by `pip freeze`, as pip only lists Python packages. If you have installed such packages, problems may occur if you reconstruct the environment on another machine using only the requirements.txt. Instead of using `pip freeze` you can create a Conda environment file to include all packages and dependencies. This file contains all packages (including non-Python packages) and the exact Python version used in the environment.\n",

    "Conda is a powerful tool that simplifies package and environment management, especially for scientific computing and data science projects. Its ability to manage dependencies across multiple languages and its integration with Anaconda make it an ideal solution for more complex projects. pip is a smaller tool for installing Python packages from PyPI and pip is pre-installed with all pPython versions 3.4 and above. During this course pip is sufficient.\n",
