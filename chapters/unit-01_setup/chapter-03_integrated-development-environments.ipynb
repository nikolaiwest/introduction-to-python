    "## **Chapter 3.1:** What are IDEs?\n",
    "\n",
    "An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development within a single interface. Popular IDEs for Python development are `Visual Studio Code`, `Spider` and `Jupyter`. IDEs helps developers to write, test, and debug code more efficiently with tools such as syntax highlighting and code completion. IDEs integrate various development tools into one platform, streamlining the coding process by reducing the need to switch between different applications for different tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key features of an IDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Code Editor:** A text editor that supports syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and sometimes code suggestions to make writing code easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compiler/Interpreter:** Tools that convert your code into machine-readable format or execute it directly, depending on the language you're using.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Debugger:** A tool that helps you identify and fix errors in your code by allowing you to run the code step-by-step, inspect variables, and track the flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Build Automation:** Tools that automate tasks like compiling the code, running tests, packaging the software, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Version Control Integration:** Many IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio Code) offer integration with version control systems like Git, allowing developers to manage source code versions directly from the IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Some IDEs provide GUI design tools for building and designing user interfaces.\n",

    "## **Chapter 3.2:** Jupyer notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive web interface to Python, with support for *over 40 programming languages*. They have become a staple in data science and academic research for their ability to combine executable code, rich text, equations, and visualizations in a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of Jupyter Notebooks**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interactive Code Execution:** Run code in cells, see outputs immediately, and make adjustments in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rich Text and Formatting:** Supports `Markdown`, `HTML`, `LaTeX`, and embedded images for comprehensive documentation alongside code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Visualization:** Integrates with libraries like `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly` to produce interactive graphs and charts directly in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extensibility and Plugins:** Enhance functionality with extensions for version control, code formatting, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Use Jupyter notebooks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Jupyter can be installed via pip or as part of the Anaconda distribution, which already includes Jupyter and many scientific libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Via pip:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Via Conda:**  \n",
    "    Jupyter comes pre-installed with Anaconda. To ensure it's up to date:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda update notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Launch Jupyter Nootebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    To launch Jupyter Notebook open a terminal or command promt and navigate to your project directory. The command `jupyter notebook` opens Jupyter in your default web browser, displaying the notebook dashboard..\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash \n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating and Managing Notebooks:**\n",
    "    * New Notebooks: Click the \"New\" button in the upper right corner of the dashboard and select Python to start a new notebook.\n",
    "    * Saving and Naming: Name your notebook by clicking on the title area at the top. Notebooks are saved automatically but can also be saved manually with Ctrl + S.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Writing and Running Code:**\n",
    "    * Code and markdown are entered into cells. Execute cells by pressing `Shift + Enter`.\n",
    "    * Use markdown cells for narrative text, equations, or instructions.\n",
    "    * Use code cells for your program code\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Advanced Features:**\n",
    "    * **Magic Commands:** Jupyter supports special commands for various tasks, like timing code, writing files, and more functions and actions that go beyond the normal Python syntax.  \n",
    "    *Line Magics:* These commands begin with a `%` and only apply to the current line in which they are used.  \n",
    "    *Cell Magics:* These commands start with `%%` and apply to the entire cell in which they are used.\n",
    "    * **Interactive Widgets:** Enhance notebooks with interactive widgets for real-time data visualization and User interface (UI) controls. The interactive widget functionality is mainly provided by the `ipywidgets` library that you can install with pip.\n",
    "    * **Collaboration and Sharing:** Notebooks can be shared via email, GitHub, or NBViewer. [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the next-generation web-based interface for Project Jupyter, offers advanced features for collaborative work.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Syntax Highlighting and Code Completion:** Improves readability and speeds up coding with automatic suggestions and corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Use Spyder**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installation:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    Spyder can be installed in various ways, but two common methods are through `pip` and the Anaconda distribution. For isolated environments or if specific versions are needed, pip is suitable. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) is preferred for a comprehensive setup with scientific libraries pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Via pip:**  \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install spyder\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Via conda:**  \n",
    "    Spyder comes pre-installed with Anaconda. To update or install it separately, use:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda install spyder\n",
    "    conda update spyder\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Launch Spyder:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once installed, Spyder can be launched from the command line (or through Anaconda Navigator if installed via Anaconda).\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "    spyder\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configuration:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    Familiarize yourself with the layout, exploring the file explorer, editor, console, and variable explorer areas. Customize the theme and keyboard shortcuts according to your preference under `Tools > Preferences`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating and Running Scripts:** \n",
    "    * New Projects: Use `File > New Project` to start a new project with its own dedicated workspace.\n",
    "    * Running Scripts: Code can be run in the integrated IPython console or through the dedicated run buttons. Output and errors are displayed inline, facilitating quick iterations and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Advanced Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Debugging:** Spyder's debugger allows setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables at runtime, which is essential for identifying and solving issues quickly.\n",
    "    * **Version Control:** While Spyder does not have built-in `version control` features, it integrates seamlessly with tools like `Git` (we will discuss version control in Chapter 5 of this course unit). Projects managed with `Git` can be developed and tracked directly within Spyder's interface.\n",
    "    * **Extensions and Plugins:** Expand Spyder's functionality with plugins available through `pip` or `conda`, such as `spyder-notebook` for working with Jupyter notebooks within Spyder.\n",
