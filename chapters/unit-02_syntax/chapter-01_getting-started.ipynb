    "## **Chapter 1.2:** Setting Up An Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To start coding in Python, you first need to set up your development environment. This process involves installing Python on your system and choosing an editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for writing your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows:\n",
    "  1. Visit python.org and download the latest version for Windows.\n",
    "  2. Run the installer, ensuring you check \"Add Python to PATH\".\n",
    "  3. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing `python --version`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- macOS:\n",
    "  1. Install Homebrew if not already installed: `/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"`\n",
    "  2. Install Python using Homebrew: `brew install python`\n",
    "  3. Verify installation by opening Terminal and typing `python3 --version`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linux:\n",
    "  1. Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed.\n",
    "  2. To install the latest version, use your distribution's package manager, e.g., for Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing an IDE or Text Editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular choices include:\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook: Great for data science and interactive coding\n",
    "- Visual Studio Code: A lightweight, extensible code editor with excellent Python support\n",
    "- PyCharm: A full-featured Python IDE (free Community Edition available)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virtual Environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments allow you to create isolated Python environments for different projects. This helps manage dependencies and avoid conflicts between project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment:\n",
    "1. Open your terminal or command prompt\n",
    "2. Navigate to your project directory\n",
    "3. Run: `python -m venv myenv`\n",
    "4. Activate the environment:\n",
    "   - Windows: `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "   - macOS/Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "Always activate your virtual environment before installing packages or running your Python scripts for a project.\n",

    "## **Chapter 1.3:** Your First Python Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your environment is set up, let's write your first Python program: the classic \"Hello, World!\". We'll explore two common ways to write and run Python code: using a `.py` file and using a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1: *Using a `.py` File*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating the Python File:\n",
    "   - Open your chosen text editor or IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a new file and save it as `hello_world.py`. The `.py` extension indicates that this is a Python file.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - In the file, type the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Save the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Running the Python File:\n",
    "   - Open your terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Navigate to the directory containing your `hello_world.py` file using the `cd` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Run the script by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```cmd\n",
    "     python hello_world.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You should see \"Hello, World!\" printed in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: *Using a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are interactive documents containing both code and rich text elements. They're particularly popular in data science and for educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, for this course, you'll be provided with Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb extension). These files can be opened directly in your browser if you're using a cloud-based platform, or through Jupyter Notebook if installed locally. In case you are not sure how to view `.ipynb`files in an IDE, please refer to the first course unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Starting Jupyter Notebook:** *(only required if you view this online or as PDF)*:\n",
    "   - Open your terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Type `jupyter notebook` and press Enter. This will launch the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Creating a New Notebook:**\n",
    "   - In the Jupyter interface, click on \"New\" in the top right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Select \"Python 3\" (or the version of Python you're using) from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A new notebook will open. By default, it will be named \"Untitled\". You can rename it by clicking on this name at the top of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Understanding the Notebook Interface:**\n",
    "   - The notebook is divided into cells. Each cell can contain code or text (Markdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Code cells (usually) have a gray background and `In [ ]:` to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Text cells (like this one) are for explanations and don't have the `In [ ]:` marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Writing and Running Code:**\n",
    "   - In the first cell of your notebook, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - To run this cell, either click the \"Run\" button in the toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The output \"Hello, World!\" will appear below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Adding More Cells:**\n",
    "   - To add a new cell, you can click the \"+\" button in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut B (for Below) or A (for Above).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - You can change a cell's type (e.g., from Code to Markdown for text) using the dropdown menu in the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `print()` is a built-in Python function that outputs text to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The text inside the parentheses is a string, denoted by quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Jupyter Notebooks, the output of `print()` statements (and the last line of each cell if it produces a value) is displayed directly below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python's Interactive Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "For quick tests and learning, you can also use Python's interactive mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2. Type `python` or `python3` and press Enter.\n",
    "3. You'll see the Python prompt `>>>`.\n",
    "4. Type `print(\"Hello, World!\")` and press Enter.\n",
    "5. You'll see the output immediately.\n",
    "6. To exit interactive mode, type `exit()` or press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ctrl+D (macOS/Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive mode is great for testing small pieces of code or learning Python interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've written and run your first Python program in multiple environments. Each method has its advantages:\n",
    "- .py files are great for writing scripts and larger programs.\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks are excellent for data analysis, visualization, and creating documents that combine code, output, and explanations.\n",
    "- Interactive mode is useful for quick experiments and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress, you'll likely use a combination of these methods depending on your specific needs and the task at hand."
