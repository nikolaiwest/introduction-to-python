    "## **Chapter 2.1:** Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **variables** are used to store data, and data types define the kind of data a variable can hold. Understanding variables and data types is crucial for writing effective Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable in Python is a name that refers to a value stored in the computer's memory. Think of it as a container that holds data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you create a variable by assigning a value to it using the `=` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "name = \"User\"\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses **dynamic typing**, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. The type is inferred from the value assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some naming conventions:\n",
    "* Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "* They must start with a letter or underscore.\n",
    "* Names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables).\n",
    "* By convention, variable names use `snake_case` (words separated by underscores).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types. Here are the most common ones:"
