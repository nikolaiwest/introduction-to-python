    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll explore *control structures*, which are fundamental tools in Python programming that allow you to control the flow of your code. Understanding these structures is crucial as they form the backbone of logical decision-making and repetition in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control structures in Python allow you to:\n",
    "* Make decisions based on conditions *(conditionals)*\n",
    "* Repeat code multiple times *(loops)*\n",
    "* Handle errors and exceptions gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these concepts, you'll be able to write more complex, efficient, and robust Python programs. Whether you're automating tasks, analyzing data, or building applications, control structures are essential tools in every programmer's toolkit.\n",

    "## **Chapter 3.1:** Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals are fundamental control structures in Python that allow your program to make decisions based on certain conditions. They enable your code to execute different blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false. This capability is crucial for creating dynamic and responsive programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Boolean Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into conditional statements, it's important to remember the Boolean expressions from the previous chapter. These are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They often involve comparison operators:\n",
    "* `==` (equal to)\n",
    "* `!=` (not equal to)\n",
    "* `<` (less than)\n",
    "* `>` (greater than)\n",
    "* `<=` (less than or equal to)\n",
    "* `>=` (greater than or equal to)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like we have seen in chapter 2, Boolean expressions can also use logical operators:\n",
    "* `and` (both conditions must be true)\n",
    "* `or` (at least one condition must be true)\n",
    "* `not` (negates the condition)\n",
    "\n",
    "***If you are unsure how to use these expressions, take your time to take a look at the previous chapter***"

    "    5 10 15 20 25\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "**Loop control statements:**\n",

    "    * If the number is 3, skip it (use continue).\n",
    "    * If the number is 8, stop the loop (use break).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combining loops and conditionals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Create a list of temperatures (in Celsius) with at least 7 values, including some below 0 and some above 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Write a for loop that prints:\n",

    "### Tips when working with exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be specific in catching exceptions. Avoid using bare `except:` clauses as they can mask unexpected errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only catch exceptions you can handle. Let other exceptions propagate up to be handled by a higher-level exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep the code inside `try` blocks to a minimum. This makes it easier to identify which specific operation caused the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the `as` keyword to capture the exception object, which can provide more information about the error:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Some code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* When working with files: Use context managers (`with` statements) for resource management when possible, as they handle cleanup automatically:\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "    with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "        content = f.read()\n",
    "    # File is automatically closed after this block\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* When creating your own exceptions, inherit from existing exception classes. This is more advanced, we will talk about classes in chapter 5:\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "    class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "## 👨‍💻 **Practice tasks 3.3:** Using Error Handling and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to put what you've learned about error handling into practice. Complete the following tasks in new code cells in your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic exception handling:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a try-except block that attempts to convert a string to an integer. If successful, print the integer. If it fails, catch the `ValueError` and print \"Invalid input\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a list with 5 elements. Try to access the 6th element of the list. Use a try-except block to catch the `IndexError` and print `\"Index out of range\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple exceptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a program that asks the user to input two numbers and divides the first by the second. Use a try-except block to handle both `ValueError` (if the user doesn't enter a number) and `ZeroDivisionError` (if the second number is zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using else and finally:**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modify the program from task 3 to include an `else` clause that prints the result of the division if no exceptions were raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add a `finally` clause to the program that prints \"Operation completed\" whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raising exceptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write a program that asks the user for their age. If the age is less than `0` or greater than `120`, raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combining control structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Create a loop that repeatedly asks the user for a number between `1` and `10`. Use a `try-except` block to handle invalid inputs. The loop should continue until the user enters a valid number or types 'quit'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom exceptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Define a custom exception called `TemperatureError`. Then, write a program that asks the user for a temperature in Celsius. If the temperature is below `-273.15` (absolute zero), raise a `TemperatureError` with an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try completing these tasks on your own. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to refer back to the earlier sections or ask for help. Remember, in Jupyter Notebooks, you can run each cell individually to check your work as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've completed the tasks, run your cells and verify that all the exception handling works as expected. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of Python's error handling mechanisms and how to use them in various scenarios."
