    "**Objective:**\n",

    "Refine the stress and strain calculator to utilize object-oriented programming principles. Your task is to design a class that represents a material undergoing stress and strain tests. This class should encapsulate all relevant data (such as force, area, original length, and change in length) and include methods for calculating stress and strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "* **Step 1: Define a Material Class:**\n",
    "    * This class should have an initializer (__init__) that takes parameters for material_id, force, area, original_length, and change_in_length and stores them as attributes.\n",
    "    * Include the calculate_stress_strain method from Chapter 5 as a method of this class. It should calculate and return the stress and strain based on the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 2: Implement Inheritance:**\n",
    "    * Create a subclass named TestedMaterial that inherits from Material.\n",
    "    * Add any additional attributes or methods that might be relevant for a material that has been specifically tested, such as a method to display the results in a formatted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 3: Add Magic Methods:**\n",
    "    * Implement the __str__ magic method in your Material class to return a string representation of the material, including its ID and calculated stress and strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 4: Use Decorators:**\n",
    "    * Create and apply a decorator that logs each time a calculation method is called. This should print a message to the console indicating that stress or strain calculation has been performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Code Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define your decorator function here\n",
    "\n",
    "class Material:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, material_id, force, area, original_length, change_in_length):\n",

    "* Implement the `Material` and `TestedMaterial` classes as described.\n",
    "* Ensure your `calculate_stress_strain` method properly calculates and returns both stress and strain.\n",
    "* Test your classes by creating instances with sample data and calling the methods to verify correct behavior.\n",
    "\n",
