    "### [1.3 Why Numpy?](#1.3-why-numpy)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Impact of NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "The design and capabilities of NumPy have made it a critical tool for numerical computations in Python. Its impact is seen across various domains, from artificial intelligence and machine learning to genomics and astronomy. By providing an efficient and scalable array structure along with a rich collection of functions, NumPy enables researchers and professionals to perform complex mathematical operations and data analysis with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Numpy is Important for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance:** Numpy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently. This design choice optimizes processing speed and resource usage, providing a significant performance boost over standard Python lists.\n",
    "* **Functionality:** Numpy provides a comprehensive mathematical function library for operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, and much more.\n",
    "* **Interoperability:** Numpy arrays can be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container for generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined, allowing Numpy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features of Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Arrays:** Numpy's main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In Numpy, dimensions are called `axes`.\n",
    "* **Broadcasting:** The term broadcasting describes how Numpy treats arrays with different `shapes` during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes.\n",
    "* **Vectorization:** Numpy provides a concise and readable way to perform mathematical `operations` on arrays, allowing for vectorized operations. This means operations are performed on entire arrays rather than their individual elements, leading to concise and faster computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more about the advantage of Numpy Arrays compared to Python lists [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-lists-vs-numpy-arrays/).\n",
